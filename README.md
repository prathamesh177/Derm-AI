## Future Scope
Integration of Multimodal Data:

Incorporating additional data types, such as patient history, genetic factors, and environmental
conditions, could enhance the modelâ€™s predictive capabilities, providing a more holistic
diagnostic solution.

Future iterations of the model can integrate explainable AI techniques to make the predictions
interpretable for clinicians. This will build trust in AI systems by providing insights into the
decision-making process of the algorithm.

Continuously updating the model with new data to enhance its predictive capabilities and adapt
to emerging skin disease trends.

Ensuring patient privacy and data security by implementing robust encryption and compliance
with healthcare regulations.

Integrating patient medical history, genetic factors, and environmental exposures to improve
prediction accuracy.
